# eDIA RCAS
RCAS (Remote-Control-And-Streaming) is a Unity framework enabling remote control of an VR application on a HMD. 

## Description
RCAS is responsible for all networked interactions between `controller` and `executer` sides. RCAS makes it possible to do this on separate machines via network traffic. Currently only tested with Windows-based builds, but should be working as an Android APK too. Which gives opportunities for a tablet or even phone based app.
